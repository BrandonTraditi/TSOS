As for project 2/3 most things work but there are some that do not. 


Project 2: A single executed program should load, run, and update accordingly. Each of the additional frameworks are added and contain the
code to run efficiently.


Project 3: Shell commands that work are clearMem, ps, and quantum. kill and killAll will not. Run all is tricky but not quite fully 
working. Memory aspects such as partitions with base and limits are established. Readyqueue and resident list are added. And for the scheduler, I tried my best to mimic a RR proccess by involking a interrupt. I have a shell command called rrOn that will turn on the rr scheduler so please use that before testing it but it should run fine.
