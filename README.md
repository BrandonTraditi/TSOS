Known Problems:
1.) For some reason when glados runs the status command it doesn't update but if you use the up key to go back to the command and run it 
again, it then updates. Not sure why.

2.) Few of the shifted keys on the numbers trigger the up and down key. When looking online I see the decimal numbers are the same. 
Looking into solutions for this.
